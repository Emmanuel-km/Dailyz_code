# we are handling errors and exceptions in previous files
#in day 1 we have resolved every possibility of an error
#and on top of that we have a try block to handle 
#exceptions 
#the facinating part is that we have raised an exception
#with the raise keyword then handled it in the except block
#aim is to write and work on clean and effecient code thats 
#far far away from bugs

#in conditionals.py 
#introducing log files whenever their is a specific error it sentds to the log 
#files an impressive stunt there and one application of log files

#in word counter 
#noticed that a user can press nothing and counter counts as a word
#so raising an exception of valueError,catching then logging the error at 
#basic.log file

#writing a clear and understandable code in roundup
