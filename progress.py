moved on to pandas library
advanced to matplotlib visualization 
upgraded to seaborn visualization 
started on SQL
now working with api to induce the workflow
rest API to get to prompt


key take aways

understand simple logging file and sending them
numpy simplifies and it's good,fast and efficient for mathematics
pandas enhances the overview of datasets and Handle data

Deliverables 
creating an energy sustainability webpage that comes handy 

creating a webpage that studies about energy availability of a place. showing what potential energy can be harnessed. transport the electricity emersed and benefit to the society. healthy concerns  and any other concerns

the next step is leaping
creating another webpage for API sqpl pandas application 

commited on displaying the best references 

New roles kick in
Fitting description 🪵.


Loging in system
loging in dynamic systems ensure every step is called 

program structure 
a system has to have strure before being created

Adaptability
this is creating your program such a way it can accept more changes of future and technology 

dividing the system parts into blocks

the best

progress daily

how data can be ambiguous
we need to come up with ai research 
also with the aim of research assistant 

progress per chunk

the difference between consistency and persistence is the amount of work load output
